# AtlanticBluefinTuna

A repository holding local versions of the ABTMSE package and
some scripts for testing changes to the package required to
run the DD model based MP.

# Installation

Clone the repository, navigate to `testDDMP/` and open
an `R` instance. Then

```
source("runExampleMSE.R")
```

This should install all required CRAN/github packages, 
force install the ABTMSE package (ver 5.2.3) from the 
local folder, and run a couple of example closed loop
simulations.
