\textbf{Abstract} \\
We developed two classes of management procedures for Atlantic bluefin tuna based on multi-model inference. The basis of the procedures were estimation methods tuned to five operating models from the reference OM grid. For the empirical class, we used OM catchability and a stationary stock mixing distribution to estimate area biomass from the larval indices. For model-based class of MPs, we tuned 5 delay difference assessment models to each of the 5 operating models, matching stock recruit steepness and biomass for the recent historical period from 1965 - 2016. At each time step, estimates of current (empirical) or projected (model-based) biomass were generated from approved management indices. These estimates were used in harvest control rules to generate area-specific TACs, and the five TACs were averaged to produce harvest advice for the East and West area. Multiple MPs were then defined based on varying precautionary TAC caps, maximum target harvest rates, and HCR control points. We found that MPs with lower caps, lower maximum harvest rates and control points avoided overfishing on the reference grid more often. We also found that the subset of OMs that our AMs were tuned to managed to capture the uncertainty well. \\[0.2in]

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas (ICCAT) is currently conducting a management strategy evaluation (MSE)
for Atlantic bluefin tuna (ref ICCAT 2019). The technical core
of an MSE is closed loop simulation testing of candidate managment
procedures (CMPs) that provide harvest advice in the presence
of uncertainty. Uncertainty is captured by a set of operating models,
which represent a plausible range of states for the
management system.

The operating models for Atlantic bluefin tuna are based on different
hypotheses (fits) of a multi-stock, multi-area, age- and length-structured
model known as the Modifiable Multi-stock Model (M3), with 4 fishing
seasons per year, that allow for mixing of fish from both stocks in each area in a given
season (\textbf{REF TSD}). Given the inherent complexity of such
a model, it is impossible to use the same structure within a management
procedure, as management procedures must be able to be tested within
simulations in a timely manner. Therefore, management procedures must
be designed that are of lower levels of complexity than the operating model.

In this paper, we develop and test two classes of CMPs that use multi-model inference
to provide harvest advice in the MSE framework. The first class is
based on an empirical index-based method of estimating spawning stock
biomass, and the second replaces the empirical method with a multi-stock
state-space delay difference stock assessment model. Both classess are
made up of five biomass estimation and harvest control rules that are
tuned to one of five reference grid operating models. Catch advice from each
sub-procedure is then combined to produce area-specific TACs.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

Our candidate management procedures were based on multi-model inference
{[}@rossi2019inferring{]}, combining estimates of biomass and associated catch
advice from sub-procedures tuned to a subset of the reference grid of
multi-stock operating models. This multi-model formulation allowed us to
capture the biological uncertainty represented by the reference grid
of operating models.

We defined two classes of MP: empirical and model based. The empirical MPs
scale larval indices by OM estimates of catchability, while the
model-based MPs fit state space delay difference assessment model
to management indices.

\hypertarget{tuning-subset-of-operating-models}{%
\subsection{Tuning subset of operating models}\label{tuning-subset-of-operating-models}}

We chose a tuning subset of five reference grid operating models,
namely OMs 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11, to tune our estimation procedures.
These five OMs were chosen to span the three main axes
of operating model uncertainties (stock-recruit steepness, natural
mortality/maturity, and stock mixing), as well as the range of spawning
stock biomass scales and dynamics (Figure 1).

\hypertarget{empirical-estimation-procedure}{%
\subsection{Empirical estimation procedure}\label{empirical-estimation-procedure}}

The empirical estimation procedure used a simple moving average of
the two spawning stock larvel survey indices. For each time step \(t\),
and stock \(s \in \{GOM, MED\}\) the current average larvel index is
calculated as
\begin{align}
\bar{I}_{s,t} & = \frac{\sum_{t'= t-3}^{t} I_{s,t'}}{4}, 
\end{align}
where \(I_{s,t}\) is the larval index for stock \(s\) at time \(t\). We then
scaled the smoothed survey indices to multiple biomass estimates, one
for every operating model in the tuning subset, by using the appropriate
larval survey catchability parameter, e.g
\begin{equation}
\hat{B}_{s,t,k} = \frac{\bar{I}_{s,t}}{q_{s,k}},
\end{equation}
where \(q_{s,k}\) is the stock larval index catchability parameter from
the tuning operating model \(k \in \{1,2,4,7,11\}\).

Spawning stock biomass was then translated to area biomass using an
assumed constant distribution of biomass for stock mixing
\begin{equation}
P = (p_{s,a}) =  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
                .898 & .102 \\
                .1 & .9
            \end{array}
    \right),                    
\end{equation}
found by averaging the proportion of stock biomass in each area
over the historical period in the tuning set of OMs. The rows
of matrix \(P\) are indexed by spawning stocks \(\{MED, GOM\}\), and the
columns are indexed by management area \(\{ E, W\}\). This generates
an area specific biomass
\begin{equation}
B_a = \sum_{s} p_{s,a} B_s,
\end{equation}
where \(s \in \{MED, GOM\}\), \(a \in \{E, W\}\).

\hypertarget{delay-difference-model}{%
\subsection{Delay difference model}\label{delay-difference-model}}

For the model-based class of procedures, the simple index scaling
method of the empirical procedure is replaced by a state-space
multi-stock Schnute-Deriso delay difference assessment model
{[}@schnute1985general; @deriso1980harvesting{]}. The two spawning
stocks are assumed to be distinct spawning stocks for the larval
surveys, but are mixed using the distribution \(P\) for
the other management indices and the observed catches.

\hypertarget{equilibiria}{%
\subsubsection{Equilibiria}\label{equilibiria}}

Because there is no mixing of spawners, each stock has the simple Delay
Difference equilibrium states, which can be expressed as a function
of long-term fishing mortality \(f = F_s\). The equations for equilibria
in Table 1 were used to initialise the model at a fished equilibrium
in 1965, as well as estimate biological reference points for use in
the harvest control rules.

\hypertarget{biomass-time-series-reconstruction}{%
\subsubsection{Biomass time series reconstruction}\label{biomass-time-series-reconstruction}}

Each assessment model was initialised in a fished state in 1965. To do so,
we estimated an initial fishing mortality rate \(F_(s,0)\), and assumed
that the stock was at the fished equilibrium defined in Table 1. Other free
parameters were unfished biomass \(B_{s,0}\), catchability \(q_g\) and
observation error uncertainty \(\tau_g\) for biomass and abundance indices,
and recruitment process error deviations \(\omega_{s,t}\) for
\(t \in 1966,..., 2014\) (Table 2). Stock recruit steepness \(h_s\)
and natural mortality \(M_s\) were fixed to the estimated values from
the associated operating model.

We assumed the that proportion \(p_{s,a}\) of
stock\textasciitilde{}\(s \in \{MED,GOM\}\) in area\textasciitilde{}\(a \in \{E,W\}\) was
constant, allowing the fluctuations in stock biomass to
account for the mixing dynamics. We also assumed that the stocks
were homogeneously mixed in each area, so that total stock specific
catch was the sum of the area specific catches, split according
to the proportion to the stock biomass in each area (eqn ref).

We used a numerical Newton-Rhapson method to solve for instantaneous
fishing mortality at all time steps \(t \geq 1\), which were used in
the survival calculation to progress numbers and biomass to the
next time step.

We modeled recruitment process errors as a simple random
walk, rather than indepent deviations from the stock recruit curve.
We chose a random walk as it was more able to capture dynamic
recruitment regimes. Furthermore, random walks would also make
projected recruitments, which are an important component of
projected biomass in a delay difference formulation, less
likely to be average, and more like the estimated
recruitment in the last year of the assessment period.

Because this is a model-based MP and the time-series of approved
management indices are rather short, we included two additional indices.
These indices were the M3 model yearly spawning stock biomass estimates
for the East and West stocks. These biomass time series were assumed to be
observed with catchability \(q = 1\) and an observation error
CV of \(5 \%\). This allowed our AMs to estimate catchability for the
approved indices and scale them appropriately to the spawning stock biomass
from the associated operating model, which was required for extending the
fit to the approved indices in the projections, as well as making sensible
estimates of biological parameters despite the complexity mismatch between
the operating model and the assesment models.

Finally, we applied a log-normal prior distribution to unfished
biomass \(B_{0,s}\). This was applied to prevent the unfished biomass from
being estimated too close to the initial biomass for the assessment period,
and producing optimistic estimates of initial and current biomass
depletion. For each AM, the prior mean was defined as the estimate from the
associated operating model and we assumed a log standard deviation of 0.05.

\hypertarget{reference-points}{%
\subsubsection{Reference Points}\label{reference-points}}

Reference points for each stock were estimated from the equilibrium
values in (Table 1). The optimal fishing mortality rate \(F_{MSY}\)
was found by numerically solving for the stationary point of the yield
curve, and was in turn used to estimate the optimal equilibrium
biomass \(B_{MSY}\) associated with that mortality rate.

We estimated area based reference points for use in harvest control
rules, which were the stock-area biomass weighted averages of
the stock-specific reference points, i.e.
\begin{align}
B_{MSY,a} & = \sum_{s} \frac{B_{s,a}}{B_a} B_{MSY,s}, \\
F_{MSY,a} & = \sum_{s} \frac{B_{s,a}}{B_a} F_{MSY,s},
\end{align}
where \(B_{s,a} = p_{s,a} B_s\).

\hypertarget{harvest-control-rules}{%
\subsection{Harvest control rules}\label{harvest-control-rules}}

For each of the five sub-procedures we defined a ramped harvest
control rule with upper and lower control points and a maximum harvest
rate. The control points and maximum harvest rates for these rules were
based either based on the associated operating model's biological reference
points, or the , and a precautionary TAC cap was used to limit removals in
cases of bias in projected biomass or reference point estimates.

Our ramped harvest control rule was based off the rules used for
albacore tuna {[}ref{]}. These rules requires an upper control point (\(UCP\)),
a lower control point (\(LCP\)) and a maximum target harvest rate \(U_{max}\).
The general form of the rules (ignoring AM, area, and stock indices):

\begin{align}
U_{targ} =  \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
                0.1 \cdot U_{max} & B \leq LCP \\
                U_{max} * (0.1  + 0.9 \frac{B}{UCP - LCP} ) & LCP \leq B \leq UCP \\
                U_{max} & UCP \leq B 
            \end{array} \right.
\end{align}

For all HCRs, we set \(LCP = .4 UCP\), and tested two options for the
upper control point: \(UCP = B_{MSY}\) or \(UCP = .4 B_0\). We also tested
two options for the maximum target harvest rate at \(U_{max} = F_{MSY}\)
and \(U_{max} = \frac{2\cdot M}{3}\). Under the empirical management
procedures, control points were taken from the tuning
grid of operating models, while under the model-based MPs,
control points were taken as the delay difference model
equilibria.

We applied a TAC cap in each area to make the HCRs more precautionary. This
extra precaution is required to guard against optimistic assessment errors
and biases in reference point calculations, both of which are\\
caused by the complexity mismatch between the AMs and the OMs. We tested
three kinds of caps: a high cap of 25 kt in the East, and 4 kt in the West;
a low cap of 20 kt in the East, and 2.5 kt in West; and a cap of the
stock and area based MSY, which was derived from assessment model
equilibria (Tables 1 and 3, Figure 2).

Both home-stock- and area-based harvest control rules were applied for
East and West area TACs. For example, in the East area, HCRs were applied
based on East (MED) spawning stock biomass compared to the East stock
control points and harvest rates, and East area biomass compared to mixed
stock control points and harvest rates. Mixed area based control points
and harvest rates were averaged over the two stocks present in the area,
weighted by the proportion of stock specific biomass in that area
(e.g.~see area-based reference points calcs in previous section), and
the lower of the two TACs was chosen. From this, the West TAC would almost
always be managed according to the Gulf of Mexico spawning stock harvest
control rules, and the East TAC would almost always be managed according
to the mixed East Area harvest control rule, as this includes the weaker
stock.

\hypertarget{providing-catch-advice-by-area}{%
\subsection{Providing catch advice by area}\label{providing-catch-advice-by-area}}

To provide a single TAC at each time step we averaged over the TAC
advice from the 5 sub-procedures for both the empirical and
model-based MPs. For the model-based MP, we tested two weightings
for the averaging: equal weighting (standard mean), and weighting
by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). For the empirical MPs,
we fully tested only a simple average weighting.

To calculate the AIC weighting across the tuning grid, we used only
the observation model likelihood components for the approved management
indices. This is because the approved management indices were data
that were common among the tuning grid AMs, while the included OM
spawning stock biomass indices differed between AMs, invalidating
the assumptions of AIC.

Final TACs were then smoothed with respect to the previous management
interval's TAC. This smoothing allowed a maximum increase of 20\%, and
a maximum decrease of 50\%, compared to the previous management interval.

\hypertarget{simulation-experiments-and-performance-metrics}{%
\subsection{Simulation experiments and performance metrics}\label{simulation-experiments-and-performance-metrics}}

Rather than run the entire grid of management procedures
defined by Table 3, we ran three batches of CMPs:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Empirical MPs with MSY caps:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{empMP\_msyCap}, \textbf{empMP\_msyCap.4B0}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Equal weighted delay-difference MPs with MSY caps:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{MP\_msyCap}, \textbf{MP\_msyCapF23M}, \textbf{MP\_msyCapF23M.4B0}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  AIC weighted delay difference MPs with MSY caps:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{MP\_aic\_msyCap}, \textbf{MP\_aic\_msyCapF23M}, \textbf{MP\_aic\_msyCapF23M.4B0}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The suffix \(.4B0\) indicates that the proxy UCP of \(.4B_0\) is
applied, and F23M indicates that the maximum harvest rate
is set at \(\frac{2}{3}M\), where \(M\) is fixed to the associated
operating model in the tuning subset.

All MPs were evaluated over the 12 reference grid operating
models, labelled OM\_1 through OM\_12, as well as three
additional robustness operating models, OM\_13 to OM\_15.
To compare performance of each MP, we calculated distributions
of the performance metrics
\begin{align}
B_{30} &= \frac{B_{2046}}{B_{MSY}}, \\
AvC_{30} &= \frac{\sum_{t = 2016}^{2046} C_t}{30}
\end{align}
over the set of simulation replicates for each stock, MP and
operating model combination.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{fits-of-delay-difference-ams-to-historical-data}{%
\subsection{Fits of Delay Difference AMs to historical data}\label{fits-of-delay-difference-ams-to-historical-data}}

We found that by fitting the delay difference assessment model to operating
model biomass, we could recapture the operating model biomass series
faithfully (Figures 2 and 3). Management indices were then able to scale
to the stock biomass and estimates of catchability parameters were suitable
for the delay difference assessment (Figure 3).

We found that assessment model estimates of biological parameters
and equilibria, and operating model estimates of the same quantities, were
less consistently similar. While the log-normal prior on unfished biomass
worked well to keep \(B_{0,s}\) estimates close to the operating model values,
the model equilibria were often biased. For example, in AMs 1, 4, and 7, the
DD model \(F_{MSY}\) values for the Mediterannean spawning stock are at least 0.17,
in contrast with the operating model values, which were at most 0.13. Similarly,
in the same assessment models, \(B_{MSY}\) values were around 50\% of the corresponding
operating model values. This led to similar values for maximum sustainable
yield \(MSY\), indicating that the biases in \(F_{MSY}\) and \(B_{MSY}\) were negatively correlated.
These biases have implications for the performance of MPs that rely on the
AM reference point estimates to set TACs, which we describe below.

\hypertarget{performance-in-projections}{%
\subsection{Performance in projections}\label{performance-in-projections}}

\hypertarget{empirical-mps}{%
\subsubsection{Empirical MPs}\label{empirical-mps}}

As expected, emprirical CMPs did a decent job of
predicting future spawning stock biomass (Figure 6).
This is unsurprising, as empirical CMPs were tightly
tuned to the tuning subset of OMs, using catchability
from the two larval surveys, and OM reference points
for the harvest control rules in each sub-procedure.

We found that the proxy upper control point was not
necessary for the empirical MPs. This was indicated
by the almost identical performance metrics between
those MPs that used OM \(B_{MSY}\), and those that used
40\% of OM \(B_0\), as the harvest control rule's upper
control point (Figure 7).

Empirical MP performance was more variable across
reference grid operating models for the East stock
than in the West. For example, under MPs that
used the OM MSY as the TAC cap, \(B_{30}\) ranged
between 0.5 and 1.5 in the East for all reference
and robustness OMs, while in the west the same metric
was often between 1.5 and 2 on the reference grid,
with the exception of OMs 4 and 5.

The high values of B30 in the west probably indicate that
the empirical MPs are too conservative for that stock,
and TACs could be set higher for fishing that catches
the Gulf of Mexico stock.

There was very little difference in the \(AvC_{30}\) metric between
operating models in the East, indicating that the MPs tended to
set TACs around the caps. In the west, there was more variability
in the distributions of \(AvC_{30}\), but the medians were similar
across OMs.

\hypertarget{delay-difference-model-based-mps}{%
\subsubsection{Delay Difference Model-based MPs}\label{delay-difference-model-based-mps}}

Similar to the empirical MPs, we found the model based
MPs to fit the spawning stock biomass in a tuning subset
operating model reasonably well (Figure 8). Again, this is
unsurprising given the close tuning each AM has to its
associated tuning subset operating mode.

We found MPs that used proxy values for the upper control point
and maximum target harvest rates produced higher ratios
of biomass to \(B_{MSY}\) in 2046 than those that used the delay
difference model reference points (Figures 9 and 10, upper panels).
This was due to the bias in the delay difference reference
points discussed above, where \(F_{MSY}\) was positively biased
and \(B_{MSY}\) was negatively biased. Because of this, although some
AM estimates of current and projected biomasses were
often very close to the OM biomass, the biomass relative
to \(B_{MSY}\) was above the upper control point, so
the positively biased maximum target harvest rate was
applied and overfishing occurred.

The effects of the proxy harvest rate and upper control point
were different in the east and the west. In the east, the two
proxy MPs we tested for both mean and AIC weighted TACs produced
very similar \(B_{30}\) and \(AvC_{30}\) distributions across all
OMs (Figures 9 and 10, left hand panels). In contrast, in the
West the \(B_{30}\) metric was most affected by the \textbf{msyCapF23M.4B0}
MP with both proxies applied, while the \textbf{msyCapF23M} MP had
less of an effect. The difference was more evident in the average
catch metric, with the \textbf{msyCapF23M.4B0} MP reducing average
catch by about 500t, compared to an often negligible reduction for the
\textbf{msyCapF23M} (Figures 9 and 10, right hand panels).

THe AIC weighted MPs (Figure 9) were a little less precautionary
than the equal weighted MPs (Figure 10). Average catches
were about 10\% higher, and relative biomass a little lower.
In general, the relative ranking of MPs with the AIC and
equal weighting classes was the same, as discussed above;
however, the distance between the medians values of each
metric within an OM was a little greater for the AIC
weighted class. This is likely an indication of the
shifting TAC weighting at each time step, which allows
the TAC to change more rapidly as new data becomes available.

\hypertarget{performance-of-cmps-on-oms-outside-of-the-tuning-subset}{%
\subsubsection{Performance of CMPs on OMs outside of the tuning subset}\label{performance-of-cmps-on-oms-outside-of-the-tuning-subset}}

Our CMPs had mixed performance on the reference grid OMs outside
of the tuning subset. These were OMs 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 12.

Overall, our MPs had low \(B_{30}\) values on OMs 3, 6, 9, and 12
in the East; however, these OMs have a recruitment regime shift that was
erroneously implemented (Carruthers, pers. comm., 2019), switching
the recruitment regimes between spawning stocks and time periods,
creating a larger reduction in steepness values between regimes
than was intended in the East, and a smaller reduction in the West.

On the remaining OMs, that differ from the tuning subset
by mortality/maturity and stock mixing, the AIC weighted model-based
MPs performed the best on the \(B_{30}\) metric. Out of those, the AIC
weighted MP \textbf{MP\_aic\_msyCapF23M} performed the best in the East,
coming the closest to \(B_{30} = 1\) on OMs 5, 8, 9, and 10 and 12.
The same MP was more precautionary in the West, often selecting
lower TACs than necessary under the AIC weighting (Figure 11).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In this paper, we tested multiple empirical and model-based
candidate management procedures (CMPs) for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna. These
CMPs were based on multi-model inference, where TACs from
5 procedures, each tuned to a specific reference grid OM, were
combined in some way to produce TAC advice. For empirical CMPs,
we used an equal weighting, while for model based delay-difference
CMPs, we tested an equal weighting as well as an AIC-like
weighting based on data shared between the tuned AMs.

We found tuning the CMPs to perform
similarly across the OMs and stocks was a challenge.
Our MPs were on average too precautionary in the
West area/stock, and not precautionary enough on the East
area/stock. This could be avoided by using combinations
of MPs with different caps or harvest rates in the East and West,
allowing the West catch to increase while keeping the East stable.

Similarly, choosing the correct weighting to combine
the TAC advice was challenging. The equal weighting scheme
is more robust to the issues of the AIC weighting (small differences
in AIC values tend to downweight models disproportionately),
but led to MPs that were often too precautionary. On the other
hand, while the AIC weighting was often biased, it did allow
the weights to shift between assessment periods, which created
both over and under harvesting on occasion.

Extending the empirical MP to use an unequal weighting is
our next step. We conceived of a stochastic approximation
algorithm to optimise TAC weightings {[}@spall2005introduction{]}.
This algorithm would apply gradient descent to an objective
function based on median \(B_{30}\) and \(\nabla B_{30}\) values
for a set of operating models to TAC weightings. Preliminary
tests show promise, but this is still very much under development.
