# Introduction

The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas (ICCAT) is currently conducting a management strategy evaluation (MSE)
for Atlantic bluefin tuna (ref ICCAT 2019). The technical core 
of an MSE is closed loop simulation testing of candidate managment 
procedures (CMPs) that provide harvest advice in the presence
of uncertainty. Uncertainty is captured by a set of operating models,
which represent a plausible range of states for the
management system.

The operating models for Atlantic bluefin tuna are based on different
hypotheses (fits) of a multi-stock, multi-area, age- and length-structured 
model known as the Modifiable Multi-stock Model (M3), with 4 fishing 
seasons per year, that allow for mixing of fish from both stocks in each area in a given
season (**REF TSD**). Given the inherent complexity of such 
a model, it is impossible to use the same structure within a management
procedure, as management procedures must be able to be tested within
simulations in a timely manner. Therefore, management procedures must 
be designed that are of lower levels of complexity than the operating model. 

In this paper, we develop and test two classes of CMPs that use multi-model inference
to provide harvest advice in the MSE framework. The first class is 
based on an empirical index-based method of estimating spawning stock
biomass, and the second replaces the empirical method with a multi-stock
state-space delay difference stock assessment model. Both classess are
made up of five biomass estimation and harvest control rules that are 
tuned to one of five reference grid operating models. Catch advice from each 
sub-procedure is then combined to produce area-specific TACs. 

# Methods

Our candidate management procedures were based on multi-model inference 
[@rossi2019inferring], combining estimates of biomass and associated catch
advice from sub-procedures tuned to a subset of the reference grid of
multi-stock operating models. This multi-model formulation allowed us to 
capture the biological uncertainty represented by the reference grid 
of operating models.

We defined two classes of MP: empirical and model based. The empirical MPs
scale larval indices by OM estimates of catchability, while the 
model-based MPs fit state space delay difference assessment model
to management indices.

## Choice of operating models

We chose a tuning subset of five reference grid operating models,
namely OMs 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11, to tune our  estimation procedures. 
These five OMs were chosen to span the three main axes 
of operating model uncertainties (stock-recruit steepness, natural 
mortality/maturity, and stock mixing), as well as the range of spawning 
stock biomass scales and dynamics (Figure 1).


## Empirical estimation procedure

The empirical estimation procedure used a simple moving average of
the two spawning stock larvel survey indices. For each time step $t$,
and stock $s \in \{GOM, MED\}$ the current average larvel index is 
calculated as
\begin{align}
\bar{I}_{s,t} & = \frac{\sum_{t'= t-3}^{t} I_{s,t'}}{4}, 
\end{align}
where $I_{s,t}$ is the larval index for stock $s$ at time $t$. We then
scaled the smoothed survey indices to multiple biomass estimates, one
for every operating model in the tuning subset, by using the appropriate 
larval survey catchability parameter, e.g
\begin{equation}
\hat{B}_{s,t,k} = \frac{\bar{I}_{s,t}}{q_{s,k}},
\end{equation}
where $q_{s,k}$ is the stock larval index catchability parameter from
the tuning operating model $k \in \{1,2,4,7,11\}$. 

Spawning stock biomass was then translated to area biomass using an
assumed constant distribution of biomass for stock mixing
\begin{equation}
P = (p_{s,a}) =  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
                .898 & .102 \\
                .1 & .9
            \end{array}
    \right),                    
\end{equation}
found by averaging the proportion of stock biomass in each area
over the historical period in the tuning set of OMs. The rows 
of matrix $P$ are indexed by spawning stocks $\{MED, GOM\}$, and the 
columns are indexed by management area $\{ E, W\}$. This generates
an area specific biomass
\begin{equation}
B_a = \sum_{s} p_{s,a} B_s,
\end{equation}
where $s \in \{MED, GOM\}$, $a \in \{E, W\}$.

## Delay difference model

For the model-based class of procedures, the simple index scaling
method of the empirical procedure is replaced by a state-space
multi-stock delay difference assessment model. The two spawning
stocks are assumed to be distinct spawning stocks for the larval
surveys, but are mixed using the distribution $P$ for 
the other management indices and the observed catches. 


### Equilibiria

Because there is no mixing of spawners, each stock has the simple Delay
Difference equilibrium states, which can be expressed as a function
of long-term fishing mortality $f = F_s$. The equations for equilibria 
in Table 1 were used to initialise the model at a fished equilibrium 
in 1965, as well as estimate biological reference points for use in 
the harvest control rules.

### Biomass time series reconstruction

Each assessment model was initialised in a fished state in 1965. To do so,
we estimated an initial fishing mortality rate $F_(s,0)$, and assumed
that the stock was at the fished equilibrium defined in Table 1. Other free
parameters were unfished biomass $B_{s,0}$, catchability $q_g$ and 
observation error uncertainty $\tau_g$ for biomass and abundance indices,
and recruitment process error deviations $\omega_{s,t}$ for 
$t \in 1966,..., 2014$ (Table 2). Stock recruit steepness $h_s$
and natural mortality $M_s$ were fixed to the estimated values from 
the associated operating model.

We assumed the that proportion $p_{s,a}$ of 
stock~$s \in \{MED,GOM\}$ in area~$a \in \{E,W\}$ was 
constant, allowing the fluctuations in stock biomass to 
account for the mixing dynamics. We also assumed that the stocks
were homogeneously mixed in each area, so that total stock specific 
catch was the sum of the area specific catches, split according 
to the proportion to the stock biomass in each area (eqn ref).

We used a numerical Newton-Rhapson method to solve for instantaneous
fishing mortality at all time steps $t \geq 1$, which were used in 
the survival calculation to progress numbers and biomass to the 
next time step.

We modeled recruitment process errors as a simple random
walk, rather than indepent deviations from the stock recruit curve.
We chose a random walk as it was more able to capture dynamic
recruitment regimes. Furthermore, random walks would also make 
projected recruitments, which are an important component of 
projected biomass in a delay difference formulation, less
likely to be average, and more like the estimated
recruitment in the last year of the assessment period.

Because this is a model-based MP and the time-series of approved 
management indices are rather short, we included two additional indices.
These indices were the M3 model yearly spawning stock biomass estimates 
for the East and West stocks. These biomass time series were assumed to be
observed with catchability $q = 1$ and an observation error
CV of $5 \%$. This allowed our AMs to estimate catchability for the 
approved indices and scale them appropriately to the spawning stock biomass 
from the associated operating model, which was required for extending the 
fit to the approved indices in the projections, as well as making sensible
estimates of biological parameters despite the complexity mismatch between 
the operating model and the assesment models.

Finally, we applied a log-normal prior distribution to unfished 
biomass $B_{0,s}$. This was applied to prevent the unfished biomass from 
being estimated too close to the initial biomass for the assessment period,
and producing optimistic estimates of initial and current biomass
depletion. For each AM, the prior mean was defined as the estimate from the
associated operating model and we assumed a log standard deviation of 0.05.



### Reference Points

Reference points for each stock were estimated from the equilibrium
values in (Table 1). The optimal fishing mortality rate $F_{MSY}$
was found by numerically solving for the stationary point of the yield
curve, and was in turn used to estimate the optimal equilibrium
biomass $B_{MSY}$ associated with that mortality rate.

We estimated area based reference points for use in harvest control
rules, which were the stock-area biomass weighted averages of
the stock-specific reference points, i.e.
\begin{align}
B_{MSY,a} & = \sum_{s} \frac{B_{s,a}}{B_a} B_{MSY,s}, \\
F_{MSY,a} & = \sum_{s} \frac{B_{s,a}}{B_a} F_{MSY,s},
\end{align}
where $B_{s,a} = p_{s,a} B_s$.

## Harvest control rules

For each of the five sub-procedures we defined a ramped harvest 
control rule with upper and lower control points and a maximum harvest
rate. The control points and maximum harvest rates for these rules were 
based either based on the associated operating model's biological reference
points, or the , and a precautionary TAC cap was used to limit removals in 
cases of bias in projected biomass or reference point estimates.

Our ramped harvest control rule was based off the rules used for
albacore tuna [ref]. These rules requires an upper control point ($UCP$), 
a lower control point ($LCP$) and a maximum target harvest rate $U_{max}$. 
The general form of the rules (ignoring AM, area, and stock indices):

\begin{align}
U_{targ} =  \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
                0.1 \cdot U_{max} & B \leq LCP \\
                U_{max} * (0.1  + 0.9 \frac{B}{UCP - LCP} ) & LCP \leq B \leq UCP \\
                U_{max} & UCP \leq B 
            \end{array} \right.
\end{align}


For all HCRs, we set $LCP = .4 UCP$, and tested two options for the 
upper control point: $UCP = B_{MSY}$ or $UCP = .4 B_0$. We also tested 
two options for the maximum target harvest rate at $U_{max} = F_{MSY}$ 
and $U_{max} = \frac{2\cdot M}{3}$. Under the empirical management
procedures, control points were taken from the tuning
grid of operating models, while under the model-based MPs,
control points were taken as the delay difference model
equilibria.

Both home-stock- and area-based harvest control rules were applied for
East and West area TACs. For example, in the East area, HCRs were applied
based on East (MED) spawning stock biomass compared to the East stock
control points and harvest rates, and East area biomass compared to mixed 
stock control points and harvest rates. Mixed area based control points 
and harvest rates were averaged over the two stocks present in the area, 
weighted by the proportion of stock specific biomass in that area 
(e.g. see area-based reference points calcs in previous section), and 
the lower of the two TACs was chosen. From this, the West TAC would almost 
always be managed according to the Gulf of Mexico spawning stock harvest 
control rules, and the East TAC would almost always be managed according
to the mixed East Area harvest control rule, as this includes the weaker
stock.

We applied a TAC cap in each area to make the HCRs more precautionary. This
extra precaution is required to guard against optimistic assessment errors 
and biases in reference point calculations, both of which are  
caused by the complexity mismatch between the AMs and the OMs. We tested
three kinds of caps: a high cap of 25 kt in the East, and 4 kt in the West;
a low cap of 20 kt in the East, and 2.5 kt in West; and a cap of the 
stock and area based MSY, which was derived from assessment model 
equilibria (Table 1).


## Providing catch advice by area

To provide a single TAC at each time step we averaged over the TAC 
advice from the 5 sub-procedures for both the empirical and 
model-based MPs. For the model-based MP, we tested two weightings 
for the averaging: equal weighting (standard mean), and weighting 
by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). For the empirical MPs,
we fully tested only a simple average weighting, but started 
development on a stochastic approximation method to tune the
weighting to specific biomass objectives.

To calculate the AIC weighting across the tuning grid, we used only 
the observation model likelihood components for the approved management 
indices. This is because the approved management indices were data 
that were common among the tuning grid AMs, while the included OM 
spawning stock biomass indices differed between AMs, invalidating 
the assumptions of AIC.

Final TACs were then smoothed with respect to the previous management
interval's TAC. This smoothing allowed a maximum increase of 20%, and 
a maximum decrease of 50%, compared to the previous management interval.

# Results

## Fits of Delay Difference AMs to historical data

We found that by fitting the delay difference assessment model to operating
model biomass, we could recapture the operating model biomass series
faithfully (Figures 2 and 3). Management indices were then able to scale
to the stock biomass and estimates of catchability parameters were suitable
for the delay difference assessment (Figure 3).

We found that assessment model estimates of biological parameters
and equilibria, and operating model estimates of the same quantities, were
less consistently similar. While the log-normal prior on unfished biomass
worked well to keep $B_{0,s}$ estimates close to the operating model values,
the model equilibria were often biased. For example, in AMs 1, 4, and 7, the
DD model Fmsy values for the Mediterannean spawning stock are at least 0.17, 
in contrast with the operating model values, which were at most 0.13. Similarly,
in the same assessment models, Bmsy values were around 50% of the corresponding
operating model values. This led to similar values for maximum sustainable
yield $MSY$, indicating that the biases in Fmsy and Bmsy were negatively correlated.
These biases have implications for the performance of MPs that rely on the
AM reference point estimates to set TACs, which we describe below.

We found MPs that used proxy values for the upper control point
and maximum target fishing mortality rate peformed better than those that
